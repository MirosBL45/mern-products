## Project: MERN Mini Application

This project is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) mini application that allows users to add, edit, and delete products. It includes both frontend and backend code, with the ability to toggle between dark and light themes using Chakra UI. The application was developed using the following technologies and tools:

### 1. **Framework and Core**

- **Vite.js**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects, improving performance and developer experience.

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that ensures strong typing, improving code quality and maintainability.

### 2. **Backend**

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, allowing for scalable and efficient server-side development.
  - <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Learn more about Node.js</a>
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to create the backend API for this project.

### 4. **Development and Environment**

- **dotenv**: A zero-dependency module used to manage environment variables, keeping sensitive data like API keys and database credentials secure.
